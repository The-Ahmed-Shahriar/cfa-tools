# C∀ Syntax Highlighter

C∀ Syntax Highlighter is a Visual Studio Code extension that brings syntax highlighting and lexical language support for the [C∀ (C-for-all)](https://cforall.uwaterloo.ca/) programming language.  
This extension provides you with familiar C/C++ style highlighting for your C∀ projects, along with dedicated icons for `.cfa` source files and `.hfa` header files to improve code navigation.


### Prerequisite Notice

This extension is unofficial and not affiliated with the University of Waterloo or the C∀ project. Portions of the syntax definitions are derived from the C∀ project (Copyright University of Waterloo) under [C∀'s licencing clause](LICENCE).

## Features

This extension provides:

* Syntax highlighting for the C∀ programming language (`.cfa` and `.hfa` files), a superset of the C programming language
* Custom file icons for `.cfa` source files and `.hfa` header files in the VSCode explorer.

## Known Issues

* Preprocessor directives (e.g., `#include`, `#define`) have a different colour between the `#` character and the directive name
* Identifier highlighting inconsistencies between certain capitalized vs. pascal-case namings
* No intellisense or tokenizing available - under development
